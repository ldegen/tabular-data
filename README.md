tabular-data
============

Tools for working with tabular data.

Nothing big, really.
I needed this in several of my private projects so I decided to extract it as a library.

Installation
------------

```
npm install tabular-data
```

Usage
-----
Something like this:

``` coffeescript
Table = require('tabular-data').Table

table = Table.fromArrays(...) 
```

Features, API, wtf...?!
-----------------------
Please refer to the [table-spec.coffee](./spec/table-spec.coffee).
